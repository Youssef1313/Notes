# Chapter 9 | Uniprocessor scheduling

## 9.1 Types of scheduling

- Medium-term scheduling is a part of the swapping function. This
is a decision whether to add a process to those that are at least partially in main memory and therefore available for execution.
- Short-term scheduling is the actual decision
of which ready process to execute next.

### Long-Term Scheduling (Newly created processes)

- Long-term scheduling is performed when a new process
is created. This is a decision whether to add a new process to the set of processes that
are currently active.
- There are two decisions involved.
    1. The scheduler must
decide when the OS can take on one or more additional processes. (Controls the degree of multiprogramming)
    2. The scheduler
must decide which job or jobs to accept and turn into processes. (The
criteria used may include priority, expected execution time, and I/O requirements.)
- For example,
    - the decision can depend
on which I/O resources are to be requested, in an attempt to balance I/O usage.
    - The decision as to which job to admit next can be on a simple first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis, or it can be a tool to manage system performance.
    - For interactive programs in a time-sharing system, a process creation request can
be generated by the act of a user attempting to connect to the system. Time-sharing
users are not simply queued up and kept waiting until the system can accept them.
Rather, the OS will accept all authorized comers until the system is saturated, using
some predefined measure of saturation.

### Medium-Term Scheduling (Swapping)

- part of the swapping function.
- the swapping-in
decision will consider the memory requirements of the swapped-out processes. (eg. whether the process space takes large portion of the main memory)

### Short-Term Scheduling (Dispatcher)

- Invoked when :
    - whenever an event occurs that may lead
to the blocking of the current process or that may provide an opportunity to preempt
a currently running process in favor of another (eg. interrupts, syscalls, lock signals)

## Scheduling Algorithms (For Short-Term Scheduling)

### Short-Term Scheduling Criteria

- **User-oriented criteria** relate to the behavior of the system as perceived by the individual
user or process. (An example is response time in an interactive system. Response
time is the elapsed time between the submission of a request until the response
begins to appear as output. This quantity is visible to the user and is naturally of
interest to the user.)
- **System-oriented criteria** the focus is on effective and
efficient utilization of the processor. (An example is throughput, which is the rate
at which processes are completed. This is certainly a worthwhile measure of system performance and one that we would like to maximize)
- **Performance criteria**
    - **Performancene-related criteria** are quantitative and generally can be readily measured. (eg. response time and throughput).
    - **non-Performancene-related criteria** are
either qualitative in nature or do not lend themselves readily to measurement and
analysis. (eg.  predictability: We would like for the service
provided to users to exhibit the same characteristics over time, independent of other
work being performed by the system).

### Pure priority scheduling scheme
- lower-priority
processes may suffer starvation when there is always a steady supply
of higher-priority ready processes

### Alternative Scheduling Policies
- The selection function
    - determines which
process, among ready processes, is selected next for execution
    - may be based on the execution characteristics of the
process (Service, waiting, execution times)

- The desicion mode
    - Non-preemptive: In this case, once a process is in the Running state, it continues to execute until (a) it terminates or (b) it blocks itself to wait for I/O or to
request some OS service.
    - Preemptive: The currently running process may be interrupted and moved to
the Ready state by the OS.
        - The decision to preempt may be performed when
a new process arrives OR when an interrupt occurs that places a blocked process in the Ready state OR periodically, based on a clock interrupt.

#### Policy 1 : FCFS
- As each process becomes ready, it joins the ready queue. When the currently
running process ceases to execute, the process that has been in the ready queue the
longest is selected for running.

- **Problems**
    - performs much better for long processes than short ones.
    - tends to favor processor-bound processes
over I/O-bound processes
    - Consequently, may result in an inefficient use of both the processor and the I/O devices.
    - Needs to be combined with a priority scheme to provide an effective scheduler.
#### Policy 2 : ROUND ROBIN
- use preemption based on a clock.
- A clock interrupt is generated at periodic intervals. When the interrupt
occurs, the currently running process is placed in the ready queue, and the next
ready job is selected on a FCFS basis.(**time slicing**)

- **Strengths**
    - reduce the penalty that short jobs suffer
with FCFS
    - effective in a general-purpose time-sharing system
or transaction processing system

- **Problems**
    - the principal design issue is the length of the time quantum or slice, to be used.
        - If the quantum is very short, then short processes will move
       through the system relatively quickly producing processing overhead involved in handling the clock interrupt and performing the scheduling and
       dispatching function. Thus, very short time quanta should be avoided.
    - processor-bound processes
tend to receive an unfair portion of processor time, which results in poor performance for I/O-bound processes, inefficient use of I/O devices, and an increase in the
variance of response time.

##### Virtual Round Robin (VRR)

- enhancement to minimize unfairness against IO-bound processes.
- uses an FCFS auxiliary queue to which processes are moved after being released from
an I/O block.
- When a dispatching decision is to be made, processes in the auxiliary queue get preference over those in the main ready queue. When a process is
dispatched from the auxiliary queue, it runs no longer than a time equal to the basic
time quantum minus the total time spent running since it was last selected from the main ready queue.

### Policy 3 : Shortest Process Next (SPN)
- a non-preemptive policy in which the process with the shortest expected processing
time is selected next.
- **Problems**
    - the need to know or at least estimate the
required processing time of each process. If the programmerâ€™s
estimate is substantially under the actual running time, the system may abort the job.
    - the possibility of starvation for longer processes, as long
as there is a steady supply of shorter processes.
    - not desirable for a time-sharing or
transaction processing environment because of the lack of preemption
### Policy 4 :  Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) "The preemptive version of SPN"
-  the scheduler always chooses the process that has the shortest expected remaining processing time.
- **Problems**
    - the scheduler must have an estimate of
processing time to perform the selection function
    - elapsed service times must be recorded, contributing to overhead.
    - there is a risk of starvation of
longer processes.
    - SRT should also give superior turnaround time performance to SPN, because a short job
is given immediate preference to a running longer job.

>turnaround time (TAT) is the residence time T
r, or total time that the item spends in the system (waiting time plus
service time).

### Policy 5 :  Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
- schedules based on the normalized
turnaround time, which is the ratio of turnaround time to actual service time

![ratio](/imgs/hrrn.png)

- **Strengths**
    - accounts for the age of the process. While
shorter jobs are favored (a smaller denominator yields a larger ratio), aging without
service increases the ratio so that a longer process will eventually get past competing shorter jobs.
- **Problems**
    - Service time must be estimated.

### Policy 6 : Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduling

![9.10](/imgs/9.10.png)
- When a process first
enters the system, it is placed in RQ0 (see Figure 9.4 ). After its first preemption,
when it returns to the Ready state, it is placed in RQ1. Each subsequent time that
it is preempted, it is demoted to the next lower-priority queue.
- So, a short process will
complete quickly, without migrating very far down the hierarchy of ready queues.
A longer process will gradually drift downward. Thus, newer, shorter processes are
favored over older, longer processes.
- All queues are on FCFS basis except the lowest priority (RQn) is on round Robin basis.
- **Problems**
    - the turnaround time
of longer processes can stretch out alarmingly. Indeed, it is possible for starvation to
occur if new jobs are entering the system frequently.
- **Solution**
    - we can
vary the preemption times according to the queue: A process scheduled from RQ0
is allowed to execute for one time unit and then is preempted; a process scheduled
from RQ1 is allowed to execute two time units, and so on.

### Policy 7 : Fair Share Policy
- the concern is not how a particular process performs but rather how
his or her set of processes, which constitute a single application, performs. Thus, it
would be attractive to make scheduling decisions on the basis of these process sets.
- For example, in a time-sharing system, scheduling decisions
could then be made that attempt to give each group similar service.
